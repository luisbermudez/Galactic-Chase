This is my first Ironhack's course project. Galactic Chase is a simple videogame created applying everything learnt in the first module.

This is a videogame about an astronaut in his little ship fighting against a UFO. The UFO grows everytime you move, your <b>mission</b> is to not let him grow by shooting at him.
<br>
<br>
These are the instructions:
<ul>
<li>1. The UFO grows everytime you move.</li>
<li>2. The blue and pink waves get on to let you know you can shoot.</li>
<li>3. When you shoot at the UFO, he will shrink.</li>
<li>4. You can only shoot when you are over him.</li>
<li>5. If you go over the shooting star, you get special powers and will be able to shoot even if you are not close to the UFO.</li>
<li>6. Don't shoot when the UFO's green light is on as every bullet will make him bigger instead.</li>
</ul>
